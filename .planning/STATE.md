## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- TG-first build order: validate full flow with one messenger before multi-messenger complexity
- Modular monolith with adapter pattern: isolate messenger-specific logic from business rules
- PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenant isolation: defense-in-depth beyond application-level filtering

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MAX Mini App bridge API documentation is sparse -- needs investigation before Phase 5
- Robochecks receipt annulment/cancellation flow poorly documented -- needs testing before Phase 3
- Robokassa merchant model (per-master accounts vs platform account) needs business decision before Phase 3
